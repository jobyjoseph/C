`int` data type stores integers. They take 4 bytes of memory. `int` range is 2^31...0...2^31-1.

`unsigned` is a qualifier. `unsigned int` range is 0.....2^32-1.

`char` data type stores characters. They take 1 byte of memory. `char` range is 2^7...0...2^7-1.

`float` stores real numbers, ie numbers with decimal points. It takes 4 bytes of memory.

`double` is more precise. It takes 8 bytes of memory. Therefore it is more precise.
